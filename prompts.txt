Prompt 2: Design System & Global Theme

"Now that the project is scaffolded, let's create the design system. The research doc and my initial brief mention a 'modern appeal' with 'natural colors of wood and forest.'

Please generate a plan to:

Create a global theme.ts file.

Define a color palette within this theme. It should include primary, secondary, background, surface, text, and accent colors based on the 'wood and forest' concept (e.g., various browns, greens, beiges, and a high-contrast color for actions).

Define a typography scale (e.g., h1, h2, body, caption) with font sizes and weights.

Define a global spacing scale (e.g., sm: 4, md: 8, lg: 16).

Create a ThemeProvider (using React Context) that provides this theme to the entire application.

Wrap the root App component with this ThemeProvider.

Before you build your plan, please ask me clarifying questions. For example:

'Could you provide 2-3 images of 'wood and forest' aesthetics you find appealing so I can extract a more accurate color palette?'

'Do you have a preference for the primary font? A clean sans-serif like 'Inter' or 'Roboto' is common for modern apps, but we could explore others.'

'Should we plan to support both light and dark modes from the beginning?'"

Prompt 3: Home Screen ("Mini-App" Launcher)

"With the theme in place, let's build the main HomeScreen. This screen will serve as the dashboard or launcher for all the individual tools within the app.

Please generate a plan to:

Create the HomeScreen.tsx file and add it to the main Stack Navigator.

Design a user-friendly layout to list the available 'mini-apps' (e.g., 'Board Foot Calculator,' 'Fraction Calculator'). This layout should be easily expandable as we add more tools.

Each item in the list should be a pressable component (e.g., a 'card') that includes the tool's name and a simple icon.

Ensure the navigation is functional: tapping on 'Board Foot Calculator' should navigate to a (currently blank) BoardFootCalculatorScreen.

Before you build your plan, please ask me clarifying questions. For example:

'Do you prefer a grid layout or a vertical list for the mini-apps on the home screen?'

'The research doc implies a phased rollout (MVP, Power User, Business). Should the home screen be sectioned by these categories (e.g., 'Calculators', 'Business Tools')?'

'What icons should we use? Should I use a library like expo/vector-icons?'"

Prompt 4: First App - Board Foot Calculator

"This is our first major feature. We will build the 'Board Foot Calculator' based exactly on the specifications in Section 1.1 of the Woodworker App Feature Research.txt document.

Please generate a plan to:

Create the BoardFootCalculatorScreen.tsx file.

Implement the UI for all inputs: Thickness, Width, and Length.

Implement the core logic for both board foot formulas (length in feet vs. inches).

Implement the 'Tally Feature' to allow users to add multiple calculations to a list and see a running total.

Implement the 'Integrated Costing' feature (an input for price-per-board-foot) that updates the total cost.

Implement the 'Waste Factor' feature (a percentage input) that adjusts the final total.

Implement the 'Nominal vs. Actual Thickness' UI. This must be clear and intuitive, perhaps using a dropdown for common nominal sizes (4/4, 5/4, etc.) with an info-tooltip, as suggested in the research.

Ensure the design adheres to our new global theme.

Before you build your plan, please ask me clarifying questions. For example:

'For the 'Tally' feature, should users be able to edit or delete individual entries from the list?'

'For the 'Nominal vs. Actual' UI, would you prefer a toggle, a dropdown, or a segmented control?'

'The doc mentions an 'Add to Inventory' button as a future integration. Should I add this button now in a disabled state as a placeholder?'"

Prompt 5: Planning for the Remaining MVP Apps

"Excellent. Now that we have a template for building a 'mini-app,' I need you to create the prompts for the remaining 'Phase 1' (MVP) features.

Your task is to generate a separate, future-use prompt for each of the following features, based on the research document:

The Woodworker's Fraction & Conversion Calculator (Section 1.2)

Project Pricing & Quoting Engine (Section 1.3)

In-App Reference Libraries (Section 4.3)

For each feature, you must generate a prompt that follows this structure:

Start with: 'Our next task is to build the [Feature Name].'

State the file to be created (e.g., FractionCalculatorScreen.tsx).

Explicitly state that the implementation must be based on the corresponding section in Woodworker App Feature Research.txt.

List the key 'Core Functionality' and 'Advanced Features & Nuances' from that section as the primary requirements.

End the prompt by instructing me to: 'Before you build your plan, please ask me clarifying questions.' and include 1-2 example clarifying questions specific to that feature (e.g., 'For the Fraction Calculator, what should the default precision rounding be set to?')

Before you generate these prompts, please ask me clarifying questions. For example:

'Are these three features (Fraction Calc, Pricing Engine, Reference Libraries) the correct ones to plan for next, aligning with the MVP?'

'After we plan for these, do you want to move on to planning Phase 2, or focus on building the MVP first?'"
